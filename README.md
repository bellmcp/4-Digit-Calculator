* [Download LogicWorks™ 5.0 (.zip | 11.3 MB)](https://bellmcp.github.io/work/LogicWorks5.zip)

# Install Guide :

* Download and Install LogicWorks™ 5.0
* Download .cct project file and open with LogicWorks

# What I Learned :

* Developed a 4-Digit calculator within the circuit logic board simulator software (LogicWorks™)
* Developed a user interface within the circuit logic board.
* Implemented functinality to the calculator: `ADDITION`, `SUBTRACTION`, `MULTIPLY`, `DIVISION` & `INVERT`.
* Implemented a 7-segment display using logic gates.

# Future ideas include :

* Extends ability to display and calculate more digits of number.
* Add an ability to have the square root and percentage function.
